# spatial-datascience-portfolio
This is a portfolio of my data analyses and maps using ArcGIS Pro (Spring 2025)

# About Me 
I am a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I hope to begin working in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania upon graduation. 


# What I hope to learn
I am using this class as a time to dive deeper into ArcGIS Pro through my project with The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. I hope to learn new ways that I can use ArcGIS to assist in visualizing problems and solutions.
